Challenge 1 : Javascript injection
----------

Description - a TA developer forgot to escape strings on his web page. Vandalize the page and embed https://www.staggeringbeauty.com/ into the *background* of the page

`Hint: There's a private sesson that only you have access to. Use it (you can make as many as you want)`

Challenge 2 : Cross site scripting
----------
Description - The same TA developer forgot to enable features that prevents cross site forgery exceptions. Write a query that will log out any logged in users when they see the page. Bonus points (+5) if you successfully lock the open session with you as last flag claimer

`Hint: If you read the source, you'll see that the url to logout is just a GET/POST request`

If the open session page is too clogged up with garbage, ask quan to help clean it out for you.
